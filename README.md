## Synopsis

My research is focusing on modelling the intracellular signalling of uterine natural killer (NK) cell. We wanted to know how uterine natural killer cell make the decision not to kill trophoblast during implantation, whilst peripheral NK cells are likely to kill the incoming foreign cells. The aim of this project is to develop computational models that describe the key signaling pathways that regulate the interaction between placental cells (trophoblasts) and maternal immune cells present at the interface between the uterus and placenta (specifically uterine/decidual natural killer cells which make up 75-80% of the immune cells in human and primate tissue at this interface).

## Motivation

The understanding of how uNK cells make decision in the placenta will help to avoid complication during pregnancy like pre-eclampsia and spontaneous miscarriage.

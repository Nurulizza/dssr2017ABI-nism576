## Vision(why?)

###### To understand how PI3K signalling pathway works in uNK cells and how is it different from pNK cells.

# Mission(what?)

## To get a complete model of PI3K signalling pathway.

## 1. Find the research gap. The data that I got at the moment are from peripheral blood NK cell. What make it different for uterine natural killer cell?

## 2. Search for computational modelling work that has been done on PI3K signalling pathway. 

## 3. Write ODEs for the pathway

## 4. Simulate the pathway

## 5. Optimize the model using genetic algorithm optimization

## 6. Sensitivity analysis

## 7. Validation


# Success Criteria

## 1. Have an optimized model 

## 2. The model work with new data (The model is valid!!)
